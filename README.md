# Predictive Maintenance ETL + ML

## Project Overview
*This project implements an **end-to-end predictive maintenance system** using the **AI4I 2020 dataset***.  

The pipeline simulates IoT-style streaming of machine sensor data, performs automated ETL/ELT for processing and warehousing, and integrates an ML model to predict equipment failures. Predictions are served via a FastAPI service and results are visualized in Power BI dashboards.

##  Problem Statement
Modern manufacturing environments rely on continuous monitoring of equipment to prevent costly downtime.  
The objective of this project is to design a scalable data pipeline that:
1. Ingests and processes machine sensor data in real time.  
2. Transforms and stores it in a warehouse with a dimensional model for analytics.  
3. Trains and deploys a machine learning model to predict machine failures.  
4. Exposes predictions via an API and provides business insights through dashboards.
